## Running the Code
In order to run the model, we advise you build a separate anaconda environment for each modesl. The models can be found in the [src/models](src/models) folder. The requirements for each model can be found in the same folder. You also have detailed instructions on how to run the models in the same folder.

## Metrics
To evaluate all output images, run the following command:
```
python src/metrics/evaluate.py
```
